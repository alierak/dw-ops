Boostrapping the Puppet service:

Note: this assumes that the Puppet master is running on a host with a name
(or CNAME) of puppet.$domainname (e.g.: puppet.dreamwidth.org).  If this is
not the case, the client will need to be told where the Puppet server is
before the service will start and request a certificate from the master.

For the Puppet master node, the following must be done:

  * Install puppetmaster ("apt-get install puppetmaster").
  * Copy etc/puppetmasterd.conf to /etc/puppet/puppetmasterd.conf.
  * Copy the manifests directory to /etc/puppet/manifests.
  * Copy the modules directory to /var/lib/puppet/modules.
  * Restart the puppetmaster service ("/etc/init.d/puppetmaster restart").

Ideally, the manifests and modules directories will be kept in revision
control and installed via a checkout/update procedure.  Note that on the
puppet master node, the puppetmasterd.conf file will be reloaded from
puppet after the system is set up and that node added (see notes in
manifests/site.pp).

Once the Puppet master is running, new nodes can be added with the
following procedure:

  * Add the new node name to manifests/site.pp on the master
  * apt-get update (to get the latest package information)
  * apt-get dist-upgrade (to upgrade packages)
  * apt-get install puppet
  * On the puppet master, sign the new certificate
    ("puppetca --sign newnode.dreamwidth.org")
  * restart the puppet service ("/etc/init.d/puppet restart") -- this
    should load the manifest for the node, installing any new packages and
    configuring the rest of the system.
