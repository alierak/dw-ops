This is a very simple module that installs /etc/apt/sources.list.  The
default class replicates the Ubuntu Intrepid contents.

How to use

  * Create a class that inherits from "apt".
  * Use the apt::sources function to specify contents for sources.list

apt::sources
  Arguments:
    host: the hostname portion of the URL to load packages from (required)
    port: an alternate port to access for loading packages from the
      specified host (if not present, none is used)
    release: the Ubuntu release name, e.g.: "hardy", "intrepid" (required)
    content: alternate specification for the file contents.

  This loads the $name.erb template, replacing the template values with
  those given by host, port, and release and saves it as
  /etc/apt/sources.list.

Example:

# This uses the standard Ubuntu sources.list template, but points it at a
# local cache host running on port 8080, and requests the Hardy release.
class apt::mysources inherits apt {
    apt::sources { "default":
	host => "localcache.example.org",
	port => "8080",
	release => "hardy"
    }
}
