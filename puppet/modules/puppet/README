This module provides very simple management of the Puppet client and server
systems.

Puppet Client:
  * Installs /etc/puppet/puppetd.conf
  * Ensures that the puppet client service is running

Puppet Server:
  * Installs /etc/puppet/puppetmasterd.conf
  * Creates (if necessary) various Puppet directories
  * Ensures that the puppetmaster service is running

How to use:

include puppet
puppet::client { $hostname: ensure => present } # for a puppet client
puppet::server { $hostname: ensure => present } # for a puppet server

How to modify:

Modify the puppetd.conf or puppetmasterd.conf files in the files directory.
