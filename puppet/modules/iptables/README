Simple management of iptables rules

This module does the following:

  * Installs an iptables rule set as /etc/iptables.up.rules.
  * Installs a script /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables that loads the
    former file at network initialization.
  * Runs /sbin/iptables-restore to load the iptables rules any time
    iptables.up.rules changes.

To modify the rules:

  * Modify the template file in the templates directory that includes the
    iptables rules (for Dreamwidth, this is templates/dreamwidth.erb).

To extend:

  * Create a class that inherits from iptables.
  * Use the rules() function as indicated in init.pp
