Initial Puppet configuration for Dreamwidth
Xenacryst, 16-MAR-2009

For puppetmaster installation/bootstrapping, see INSTALLATION.

This Puppet specification does basic initialization of a new Dreamwidth
node.  The original node bootstrapping procedure is defined in the wiki
notes:

http://wiki.dwscoalition.org/notes/Production_Puppet

This specification encodes that procedure in a Puppet configuration, with
the following notes:

"dw" user:
  * The "dw" user is set up using UID 1000 and GID 1000 (group "dw")
  * The sudo line is appended to /etc/sudoers if not present

apt:
  * The /etc/apt/sources.list file is installed as noted.
  * The apt module is written to allow for alternate source hosts and port
    numbers as well as different Ubuntu distributions (e.g. "hardy",
    "intrepid").  See the module documentation for details.

system update/upgrade:
  * Not performed.  This should be done by hand at installation.

package installation:
  * Performed as part of the serverclass::dreamwidth base server.
  * Note that apache2 and the MPM package are installed with the apache2
    module and should NOT be specified in the serverclass modules
    (duplicate package specifications throws an error in Puppet).

Apache configuration:
  * Performed in the apache2 module, which is only included in the
    "webserver" server class.
  * Note that this module puts configuration snippets in
    /etc/apache2/conf.d rather than building a single apache2.conf file.
    The apache2::dreamwidth class duplicates the stock Ubuntu installation
    along with the changes noted in the wiki for Dreamwidth in this style.
    See the module documentation for details.

iptables:
  * The /etc/iptables.up.rules file is installed as specified.
  * Rather than add a line to /etc/network/interfaces, we put a short
    script in /etc/network/if-pre-up.d that loads the iptables rules.
  * iptables is reloaded when new rules are pushed out; see the module
    documentation on how to change the rules.

See the documentation in manifests/site.pp for instructions on how to add
new hosts (nodes).  If a node is not found in site.pp, a default node
definition will be applied: this is the "nonwebserver" server class node
(Dreamwidth definitions as above, but without Apache configuration and the
apache2 service disabled).
