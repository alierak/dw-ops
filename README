This repository contains configuration files used by Dreamwidth on its
production installation. Things you will find here include various tools
and files we use to configure Puppet and other such systems.

We welcome you to take a look and see how we do things, although we do not
promise to update or well document this repository.

This code is also presently unlicensed while we figure out what is the
appropriate way to license this sort of thing.

If you have any questions, please email mark@dreamwidth.org -- thanks.
